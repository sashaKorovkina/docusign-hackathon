Businesses worldwide are losing valuable time, money, and opportunities because agreement data is trapped in inefficient systems, hindering decision-making and delaying processes. This is known as the **Agreement Trap**. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQUF_XvKuZk

To illustrate the Agreement Trap: if you send Terms and Conditions to **1,000 partners or customers annually**, tracking expiration dates for renewals becomes a major challenge. The key to solving this problem lies in the **data within these agreements**.
